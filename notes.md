question 1

average = 22.5

7 reps, each 30 days

18.9 22.0 19.4 22.1 19.8 21.9 20.2

validate model, use alpha = 0.05, one-tail = 0.025

sample mean = 20.614

sample stnd deviation =

t0 = (sample mean - true mean) / (sample stnd dev / sqrt(n))

# Using OC curve, alpha, beta, finding the number of of replications needed

H0: there is no difference between our model and the true system
H1: there is a difference between our model and the true system

Type I error: α
Type II error: β

determine effect size δ, the minimum distance between the two systems we consider significant

(1 - β) on the y-axis
sample size (n) on the x-axis
